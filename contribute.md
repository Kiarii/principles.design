## Submissions

You don't need to be a giant organisation or a famous designer and author with 72.4 million followers on Twitter to submit a set of personal Design Principles.

The objective of this community is to build a resource we can learn from. There's not much value in a repository filled with 100s of examples of generic principles so here are some basic guidelines:

### Guidelines

Submissions need to contain the following:

* A set of **original Design Principles**
* A **source article**, **blog post** or **canonical page** listing a set of design principles in full detail. A source article would contain something about how you or your team came up with these principles. What you learnt. What worked, what didnâ€™t work. How do you follow these principles? Have these principles made your process better? If so, how? Overall we want to know the **story behind how you created your principles**.

Here are some great examples of those that do this:

* [Airbnb](https://airbnb.design/the-way-we-build/)
* [Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)
* [Josh Clark's "Design in the Era of the Algorithm"](https://bigmedium.com/speaking/design-in-the-era-of-the-algorithm.html)

You can submit examples from other individuals, companies or teams that you think would be useful to the community as long as you follow these guidelines and provide a source that helps us get more insight into the story behind the principles.

For more information and documentation about how to submit [take a look at the GitHub page](https://github.com/benbrignell/principles.design#contributing).

## Help needed

Each set of principles in [examples](/examples) is comprised of a number of things. For example:
* Overview
* Summary of each principle
* Source URL
* Author/creator

If any of these things are missing you'll see a "Help needed" message at the bottom of the page highlighting which things are missing.

If you want to help [visit the GitHub page for more info](https://github.com/benbrignell/principles.design#contributing).

## Roadmap
Take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/benbrignell/design-principles/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aroadmap) and feel free to comment or add suggestions.
