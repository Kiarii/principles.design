principles:
- principle: |
    Usability is everything. Focus on the user and all will be well.
- principle: |
    We use open source, non-proprietary systems. No vendor lock-in.
- principle: |
    Is it any wonder that the two hottest technology companies – Google and Apple – are iconically known for their [simplicity](https://cleanforest.co//images/simplicity.png)? Customers want elegant and simple solutions which work well.
- principle: |
    It is better to release a great new website today, than a “perfect” website next month. The best websites are [released early](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often), and are constantly evolving.
- principle: |
    What is the secret behind our success? Bad consultants make money off their clients, great consultants make money for their clients. That's it. That's the whole secret.
